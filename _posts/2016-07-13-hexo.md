title: I will try Hexo

Today I will follow the tutorial from [xiaolai]( http://xiaolai.li/2016/06/22/makecs-build-a-blog-with-hexo-on-github/) and add some new pages using Hexo.

I have tried to study JavaScript on the CodeSchool again and just finished one course that I learnt a part of.

What I really need is continuously study.

Two days early, I begin to listen some Green Apple Starter audio. I have listened two stories: _Peter Pan_ and _Beauty and the Beast_. It's quite pity that I didn't listen or read these famous fairy tales, even though I know the titles and stories.
