title: CET 6 again
---

I will take another CET-6 test again.

Last time, about 4 years ago, I got a 420 points at the test. It’s not very bad score, but I am not satisfied with it.

In the last few month, I have spent some time on studying English using the Shanbey App. I think that I will get a better score this time.

I feel that I am paying the debt which I should have done before 13 years ago. If I could pass the CET-4 or CET-6 test before I had graduated from the collage, my life would be another style.

This is probably my last CET-6 test, even though I could not get a better points. The score of the CET-6 is not important to me.

It’s about 3 hours before I should begin the test, but I don’t talk too much about this topic.

I wasted my time again in last few months. I have been doctoral  candidate about four months, but I had done few things about it. I should be work hard for my academic or my life.

In my last post, I planed to do something. But didn’t finish  most of these things. Let me start again.

1. Log my time and account everyday
2. Sleep early(before 11:00) and get up early(before 7:00)
3. Learn english everyday
4. Do research everyday(read paper, books)
5. Code everyday
6. Summary everyweek
