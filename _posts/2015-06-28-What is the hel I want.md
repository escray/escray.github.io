title: Hello again
---
After the entrance test for USTC doctoral that is April 11th, I had a little depressed which seems like no target. I did not study any more in this episode, neither professional and english, and no patience to read book.
In these about three months time, I watch the teleplay(Game of Throne Season 5), watch movies (Mad Max 4: Fury Road, Ex-Machine …), read fiction book ( 新宋 ), I like them, but those’s time consume and have little mean to my dream. Do I still have a dream?

**What’s the hell I want? **

**I want to be a freelancer, free time and free financial.** To archive which I need to be hard work for long time. And I know freelancer means more self-discipline and more effectively. In after one more year time, I will try my best to get this goal. If not, I will deadly stay this rigid architecture.

**I want to be a good father and husband, maybe a filial piety child.** I read a sentence recently which said, being a good parent means that keep healthy and leave fortune. I think this damn right, and it is also important to be company.

**I want to leave my current department.** Although it provide stable salary and living condition,  this position severely limits my development opportunities. Everyday I go to the work, but I don’t enjoy it and most of time I wast my life in my occupation. There is such a lot of world to see. I will to go to the doctoral course in September, I want use this episode to spend my restriction which maybe 5 years after leaving my current position.

**The thing I most need is time.**

Now I am 35 years old, 12931 days after my born, and my baby was 5 years old, my parent were more than 60 years old. The time I lost maybe 10 years or maybe more, if I were 25 and then I would go to USTC, I will more happier. I spend too more time to amuse myself, in the next time I should concentrate what I want, not what I like.
I will tract my time next week, then summarise my time consume, at end to improve it. Meanwhile, I will record my financial.
The last few days, I began to study English use the Shanbay after a period of time interrupted. I wish I will spend about 1 or 2 hours to study English everyday. I like the Shanbay series english study App.

I think I should write some code everyday.

I wil go to pursuit the PhD, but I have not enough academic performance. If I want get the degree, I will spend 5 years of hard time.

Next week plan:
1. english everyday
2. code everyday
3. fitness
4. week summarise
