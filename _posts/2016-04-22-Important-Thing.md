I think I spend too many time in reading and surfing, and I don't want to do my currently important task that include Concrete Mathematics Course, preparation of presentation about machine learning and or so.

I must limit my time spend on senseless and random reading and surfing. I know that the daily surfing is not more value than reading some systematical book or content.

I failed my first 30 day plan. Let's start new one.

What's the most important thing for me recently? Study hard about Concrete Mathematics and pass the exam in order to get credit. And there is another urgent and important thing that is to prepare a presentation for my machine learning class on April 27th. I want to talk about AlphoGo.

So do the important thing first.

I wan to practice my English writing with my daily learning phrase and sentence from Shanbay.

** Daily Write Practice **

Today I have annual physical examine in hospital. I have a little fat and I think I got a bit of **high cholesterol** that leads to heart troubles and this is something that does not develop overnight. I need take care of my physical and **mental health**.

This afternoon, I took my daughter to the park. The ground **is dotted with** green grass and colorful bottoms. Both **deciduous trees** and **evergreen trees** are beautiful, because it's spring now. 

Recently I does **stress out at times** becouse I spend too much time for amusement. I surfs many website **as a mean** to kill time and avoid to do my homework. The wasted time has **taken its toll** on my concrete mathematics course and assignments. Nearly everyone has lost and confussed **at one time or another**. **No matter where life take me**, I will work hard, then **relax my mind and relieves stress**. Sparing use of spare time should tend to better score in courses and high productivity in work.

Everyone has one's **life expectancy**, I think I might have 35 or 40 years to live.
