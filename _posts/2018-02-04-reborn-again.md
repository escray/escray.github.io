title: restart recording my life and thinks again
date: 2018-02-04

Last I set the title to be 'reborn' is March, 2016. It's obvious that I have not reborn successfully or continuously.

Four days ago, I was 38 years old. I know I am no longer a young man. However I have a dream that have not been achieved. I want to be a freelance and reach financial independence. It seems like I forget my purpose in the last period. I need to remind myself frequently.

In past two weeks it took me a lot of time to read a time travel fiction book named Joy of life (Qing Yu Nian, Celebrating the Remaining Life) . It's amusing but totally time consuming. I should not read fictional literature again. Carefully pick the book that I could read.

Today, I get up at 5:00. It's a good beginning. And I really want to go bed before 22:30.

In about 7 days from now to 10th, February, I would finish my Liulishuo English course. And it's high possibility that I could get my tuition back because I can meet the standards.

I am trying to find my own way that could extend my value. I think that maybe include Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and Block Chain. I need more time to learn and practice.
