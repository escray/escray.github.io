Send File

完成时间：2016.03.08
适中费时：4h

After later to 282 days ago, I finally finish this series lessons.

The first and second test cases about 'stream data’ can be passed by do nothing ?

How can I know the type of the file if it is not a text file ? from extension ?

Wired, I do nothing, but the test cases about ‘range parser’ were passed.

At the last test case, it had been spent 2 hours for me to get the test green. In the stage, I find some mistake in my previous lession what the unit test can not inspect.

With my experience, I think the first two weeks lesson is very hard to pass. Compare with that, the lesson of the last week maybe a little bit simple.

I like this course, and I might be review my code and the course.
