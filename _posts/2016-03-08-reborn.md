Many times, I wrote this topic.

I was a little confused and I should have do my homework of concrete mathematics that need a lot of time and efforts to finish. However, I spent about 4 hours to initialize this personal blog site.

I know that writing is a fit utility to help me thinking. And I also want to record some of my steps.

This semester, I have just only one compulsory class of concrete mathematics. It's a bit difficult for me those who are not good at mathe. Additionally, as a CS PhD or programmer, I should study hard and learn some basic knowledge from this class. So I spent much time on it.

 There are some other things I really want to do, I listed them together.

 1. ##Concrete Mathematics class##, compulsory class
 2. ##Machine Learning class##, my PhD course and need to give some report
 3. sike.io, ##CSS from 0 to 1 course##
 4. julyedu, ##video course## for Machine Learning, I paid for it last year
 5. ##Code Complete#, really want to read
 6. ##Node.js in Action## and other Node.js book, keep study Node.js
 7. ##Code School## course, I spend some money on it but ...
 8. ##The Leadership Pipeline##

 How many things I can do ?
