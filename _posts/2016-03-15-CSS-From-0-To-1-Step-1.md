I like this course. When I found there are some ’trick’ in the lesson, I really love it and want to directly go through this without interruption.

Additionally, I really recommented it as this online course is free, [CSS from 0 to 1](http://www.sike.io/css0to1/). You just need to chat with the mentor @hayeah and tell some funny thing to him. 

There are quite lots stuff to read and learn.

Why can not use the ‘background’ shorthand in the section about background ? I find the "background-size: cover” has not counter property in the short hand. It is not to be affect if the css like this.

```css
background-size: cover;  
background: url(../img/bg5.jpg), center, fixed;
```

Even though this is a first step of CSS course, I found there are too much detail in the technique of CSS. It’s took me quite a lot of time to read some extra stuff about this topic.

From now on, I want to quick go through this 5 steps course. (It seems like sound similar with my Node.js Express Way Course.)

This is my implement of this course: [css0to1](http://escray.github.io/css0to1/)

I think it is a good opportunity to upgrade my page at github.
