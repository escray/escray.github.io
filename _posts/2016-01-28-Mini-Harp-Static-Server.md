I study this course in the daytime, however when I couldn't sleep at night, I come to pounch in.

I feel that this course is easier than before.

In the section of "Implement the mini-harp Command", I forgot about how to create the executable that I had learnt in day 1.

I think "A Current Time Middleware" part is pretty easy after I read the artical, "Meet the Connect Framework". There are some problem for me in read the artical, because lots of middleware had been updated or changed name.

"Implement Serving Static Content" is easy too. But honestly, I read other's code. At first, I didn't understand the use of the "serve-static" middelware.

I'm glad to come back.
