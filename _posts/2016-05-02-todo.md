I study some HTML and CSS knowledge and tricks from the course of CodeSchool.com. I have almost finished the paht of HTML&CSS. After that I will restart another CSS online course, which called CSS from 0 to 1.

I think I should use these skills for webpage to refactor my web main page. There are something I want to try.

1. Bootstrap
2. SVG
