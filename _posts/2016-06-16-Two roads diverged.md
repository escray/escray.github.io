The original title might be "Two roads diverged in my future", however I thought that the "future" is a too BIG word.

After I started learning PhD program in USTC, I was confused for a long time. Should I try to fight with the hard way of doctoral degree, or might to learn and practice for full-stack programmer ?

If I could survived in the doctoral program, I can get a gold diploma and maybe have some certification to get a well job in company. There are some pros and cons:

Pros:

> diploma as a stepping stone
> training in academic environment
> improve my programming skill

Cons:

> need about four or five years
> learning curve steep 
> seperate with my family

The most important thing of my PhD course is whether I could continue this is not my decision, which depend on the leader of my department.

I want I could be a freelancer in five or more years later. If I give up my Phd degree, I can have more time to practice my software development skill.

From the current situation, I will try my best effort to pass the exam of Concrete Mathematic that will be next Monday, 20th June.

Then I will look through a book about storage that is my major topic in my academic. It's just begin. And I will attend a training course for storage that is my preparation for my study.

**Code Complete**, that is the book I always want to read.
